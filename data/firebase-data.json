However, sometimes a 4 or 5-star restaurant isn’t our ideal choice, because we are not just looking for a generic good experience - we are looking for a particularly good experience. To ensure that your expectation meets your actual experience, you need more than just the basic information and overall restaurant ratings. <br/><br/> Enter reviews - reading experiences of others can help us get an idea of what kind of experience is the restaurant most likely to provide. However, going through 20 odd reviews to search for that mention of the perfect date ambience can be tedious. And in most cases, taking a leap of faith and showing up to find that particular experience might seem like the less cumbersome option. <br/><br/> But what if we told you that you could go through hundreds and thousands of reviews in a second to help you decide if the restaurant is the right fit for your upcoming meal? <br/><br/> Welcome Reviews 2.0 - reviews that bring you closer to your perfect meal experience!",

In Flutter we can define it as the manipulation of widgets to provide an illusion of movement. Animation breathes life into the process of interaction and is especially good for mobile apps that have to be developed with limited screen estate while providing an informative and functional interface. In Flutter there are two types of animations, Tween based animation and physics-based animations. <br/><br/> In my talk, I would like to show how to easy it is to animate your app in Flutter with different types of animations and how to increase the engagement of your app with animations.",

This session will not be very practical in terms of development but will be more of an interactive session with the audience, where I will compare the different aspects of Android development in terms of comparison between App development and SDK development and pick their brains on how would they go about developing an Android Library if they got a chance. <br/><br/>For example, while a majority of the apps use famous libraries like Retrofit or Volley to do their network calls, an SDK needs to either use AsyncTask or conjure up a trick using Threads and Handlers to ensure their networking is smooth. While apps use advanced DB libraries or frameworks like Room/Realm/greenDAO, Android libraries who cannot use these because it would mean that the apps into which they land up in would also have to add them as a dependency, have to make do with SQLite. <br/><br/>Once I mention the different types of problems faced by Libraries in terms of networking, database handling, UI components, handling images/GIFs/Video, efficient library size and also handling backward compatibility, I will provide my solutions which I have used in the CleverTap Android SDK as one of the possible solutions. I will also shed some light on the process of publishing libraries on JCenter or MavenCentral. <br/><br/>",
